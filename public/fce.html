    <h1>What is Fundamentals of Computer Engineering?</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        Fundamentals of Computer Engineering is a subject that introduces students
        to the basic concepts and principles of computer engineering...
    </p>

    <h2>What do you learn in Computer Engineering?</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <p> In Computer Engineering, students gain basic knowledge of computer systems,
            digital logic design, microprocessors, and computer architecture, the use and programming
            of computers, operating systems, networking,
            databases and computer programmes applied to
            engineering.</p>
        <p>They also study programming languages, software engineering principles,
            and how to design and implement computer systems, knowledge of the structure, organization, function
            and interconnectivity of computer systems,
            programming basics, and their application for
            solving problems in engineering.
