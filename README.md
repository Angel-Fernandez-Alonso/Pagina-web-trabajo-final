# Pagina-web-trabajo-final
I started the project with the things I thought it will be easier, such as the about me, contact... And I left for the final the things I considerated more difficult, the index and the topic. I was entering an changing everything all the time, because I was scared that it were so simple or the css were wrong. But after all, it was a really entretaining and curious work
I had some problems making the photos and the css work, because I didn't know that for them to work I had to put: "../images/..."
I also had problems with some css, because the photos didn't work or were losing its position.
